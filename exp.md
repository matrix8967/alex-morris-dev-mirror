When I graduated highschool, I said that I would never go back, even if they paid me. They said they would pay me, and I went back immediately.

From 2009 until 2013 I worked at Sheridan School District, where I graduated from. This was mostly breakfix/helpdesk IT.

From 2013 until 2018 I worked at Bryant School District, where I did not graduate from. This was Server Administration work.

From 2018 until now I work at a startup in Little Rock. This is a combination of job titles - DevOps, Network Engineer, SysAdmin.

All of these jobs be summarized as "Technology Crisis Manager."

I'd love to work somewhere that focuses on Open Source technology in a meaningful sense.
