### üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Employment Journey:
When I graduated highschool in 2007 I vowed to never go back even if they paid me. In 2009, they said they would pay me, and I went back immediately.

From 2009 -> 2013 I worked as Help-desk IT at my former school district. In 2013, I transferred to a larger district which offered more opportunities. I was promoted out of Help-desk and into System Administration and Network Engineering. My final project before leaving was a KVM Cluster built using ProxMox. I was able to import the VMWare cluster built by our ancestors to continue operations. This saved a ton of money *and* allowed us to have more control and flexibility with our infrastructure.

While working in schools, I established an After-School Network Security Club for students to expand (or begin) their journey into Network Security. This allowed students to be more adventurous and creative when coming up with solutions, while encouraging a culture of openness and curiosity.

Since July of 2018 I‚Äôve worked at an education-focused start-up in Little Rock. My job title changes every hour or so depending on what that day holds: DevOps, Network Engineer, SysAdmin, CertBot, Crisis Manager, etc. I'm a jack of all trades, and master of a few of them.

### üèÜ Accomplishments:
This is a terse summary of my work in 2019:

* Scaled and automated SSL Cert Generation and Renewals.

* I also got an [award](https://www.instagram.com/p/B27RWEcA7il/) for being a super nice dude.

Here are some professional projects I'm currently working on:

<!-- # üìç Specifics:

I hate progress bars, so I made a "skill tree" to keep my false sense of superiority in R√©sum√© layouts. It's a testament to over engineering, so here's the <a href="assets/text/Resume.txt">plain text</a> if you want to cut to the chase and `curl` it into your shell, or you use arch btw.

<div align="center">

I'd love to work somewhere that focuses on Free and Open Source Technology in a <a href="https://alexmorris.dev/about.html">meaningful sense</a>. I'm not looking for a job as much as I'm looking for a way to sustain my calling.

`*` Is it still tacky to put Git on a resume in 2019? I figured it's implied since this is a <a href="https://alexmorris.dev/projects.html">gitlab</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/matrix8967/alexmorris.dev">site...</a>

`‚Ä°` From 2007 until 2009, I attended and dropped out of Community College. Robert Frost said "Don't cut what you can't untie" but that dude wasn't staring down the barrel of a student loan crisis. When I find myself in a hole; I quit digging. Also during this time, I was the worlds worst printer salesman at Office Depot. No, you don't need to buy an accidental protection plan for your printer. What're you taking your printer to the lake this weekend? C'mon. -->
