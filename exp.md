# Employment Journey
When I graduated highschool, I said I would never go back, even if they paid me. They said they would pay me, and I went back immediately. I graduated from Sheridan School District in 2007(‡) and from 2009 -> 2013 I worked as Tier-01 IT. While I did not graduate from Bryant School District, I did work there from 2013 -> 2018. This is where I really came into my own as a Linux Systems Engineer. My Magnum Opus was building a KVM/Qemu VM Cluster using ProxMox to migrate our aging and expensive VMWare hardware to something more sustainable, free, and lacking VMWare's charming Vendor Lock in.

Since July of 2018 I've worked at a start up in Little Rock. My job title changes every hour or so depending on what's happening (or not happening) that day: DevOps, Network Engineer, SysAdmin, CertBot, Technology Crisis Manager, Emotional Support Consulate.

# Accomplishments:
This is a terse and abridged version of some of my work in 2019:

* Scaled and automated SSL Cert Generation and Renewals.
* Refactored LAN infrastructure with `0` outages or downtime (during business hours.)
* Discovered and patched security issues in our products.
* Setup automated security scanning of infrastructure.
* Helped insure privacy and compliance for internal communications.
* Established and maintained our Inventory System.
* Helped and lead Recovery from production AWS disasters.
* Maintained and helped scale AWS infrastructure to meet unyielding growth.
* Published in the EFF's case study on Student Privacy.
* Published in the Q1 2020 issue of `2600: The Hacker Quarterly`

Here are some professional projects I'm currently working on:

* Creating Ansible Playbooks to finally remediate issues with the last of our 1st generation cloud infrastructure.
* Setup Keybase's SSH Key Chatbot to roll certs in  a faster and easier way.
* Setup/create more bots for alerts to slack, but also more than slack if it's a big deal.
* Planning and building our Medium-Business grade on site Data Center for our new office. :)

Here are a few personal projects I'm working on to better myself, my work, and my community:

* Creating useful, actionable Privacy/Security education materials for local organizations serving "at-risk" clients such as shelters and harm reduction centers.
* Ending my abusive relationship with Slack, and other productivity valleys to do more focused work.
* Researching local and community "Surveillance Economy" issues like ShotSpotter, and Automatic License Plate Scanners.
* Doing more volunteer work with the Mozilla Community.
* Setting up better insights into my personal network's infrastructure, such as Grafana, ELK, and Graylog.
* A never ending list of consoles or devices to [hack.](https://mastodon.social/@matrix8967/103377713638351769)

# Summary and Specific Skillsets

I hate progress bars, so I made a "skill tree" to keep my false sense of superiority in Résumé layouts. It's a testament to over engineering, so here's the <a href="assets/text/Resume.txt">plain text</a> if you want to cut the bullshit and `curl` it into your shell, or you use arch btw.

I'd love to work somewhere that focuses on Free and Open Source Technology in a <a href="https://alexmorris.dev/about.html">meaningful sense</a>.

`*` Is it still tacky to put Git on a resume in 2019? I figured it's implied since this is a <a href="https://alexmorris.dev/projects.html">gitlab</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/matrix8967/alexmorris.dev">site...</a>

`‡` From 2007 until 2009, I attended and dropped out of Community College. Robert Frost said "Don't cut what you can't untie" but that dude wasn't staring down the barrel of a student loan crisis. When I find myself in a hole; I quit digging. Also during this time, I was the worlds worst printer salesman at Office Depot. No, you don't need to buy an accidental protection plan for your printer. What're you taking your printer to the lake this weekend? C'mon.
