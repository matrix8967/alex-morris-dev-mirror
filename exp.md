### üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Employment Journey:
When I graduated highschool in 2007 I vowed to never go back even if they paid me. In 2009, they said they would pay me, and I went back immediately.

From 2009 -> 2013 I worked as Help-desk IT at my former school district. In 2013, I transferred to a larger district which offered more opportunities. I was promoted out of Help-desk and into System Administration and Network Engineering. My final project before leaving was a KVM Cluster built using ProxMox. I was able to import the VMWare cluster built by our ancestors to continue operations. This saved a ton of money *and* allowed us to have more control and flexibility with our infrastructure.

While working in schools, I established an After-School Network Security Club for students to expand (or begin) their journey into Network Security. This allowed students to be more adventurous and creative when coming up with solutions, while encouraging a culture of openness and curiosity.

Since July of 2018 I‚Äôve worked at an education-focused start-up in Little Rock. My job title changes every hour or so depending on what that day holds: DevOps, Network Engineer, SysAdmin, CertBot, Crisis Manager, etc. I'm a jack of all trades, and master of a few of them.
