When I graduated highschool, I said that I would never go back, even if they paid me. Once they said they would pay me, and I went back immediately.

I graduated from Sheridan School District. From 2009 -> 2013 I worked there as mostly breakfix/helpdesk IT.

I did not graduate from Bryant School District, but I did work there from 2013 -> 2018. This was mostly Server Administration work.

From 2018 until now I've been working at a startup in Little Rock. This is a combination of job titles - DevOps, Network Engineer, SysAdmin.

All of my past jobs could be summarized as "Technology Crisis Manager."

I'd love to work somewhere that focuses on Open Source technology in a meaningful sense.

I hate progress bars, so I made a "skill tree" to keep my false sense of superiority of Résumé layouts. I'm also a big fan of just good old fashioned plain text.

I've included a few bonus flaws and shortcomings on the bottom of the list. I feel like it's important in any new relationship to no try to hide your flaws and setup a false standard out of the gate. That way nobody's disappointed in six months when you slouch back into being your regular self. I like regular me.

`*` Is it still tacky to put Git on a resume in 2019? I figured it's implied since this is a <a href="https://alexmorris.dev/projects.html">gitlab</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/matrix8967/alexmorris.dev">site...</a>
