> Hey kid! I'm a computer!

When I graduated highschool, I said that I would never go back, even if they paid me. After they said they would pay me, I went back immediately.

I graduated from Sheridan School District in 2007 and from 2009 -> 2013 I worked as tier 1 IT.

I did not graduate from Bryant School District, but I did work there from 2013 -> 2018. This was mostly Server Administration work with a KVM/Qemu VM Cluster (ProxMox).

From 2018 until now I've been working at a startup in Little Rock. This is a combination of job titles - DevOps, Network Engineer, SysAdmin.

I guess all of my past jobs could be summarized as "Technology Crisis Manager."

I'd love to work somewhere that focuses on Open Source technology in a meaningful sense.

I hate progress bars, so I made a "skill tree" to keep my false sense of superiority in Résumé layouts. It's a testament to over engineering, so here's the <a href="assets/text/Resume.txt">plain text</a> if you want to cut the bullshit or you use arch btw.

I've included a few bonus flaws and shortcomings on the bottom of the list. I feel like it's important in any new relationship to not set up a false standard. That way nobody's disappointed in six months when you slouch back into being your regular self. I like regular me.

`*` Is it still tacky to put Git on a resume in 2019? I figured it's implied since this is a <a href="https://alexmorris.dev/projects.html">gitlab</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/matrix8967/alexmorris.dev">site...</a>
