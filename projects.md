(Segmentation_Fault)[https://gitlab.com/newyearstudios/ritual-jam] is a game I made as part of (newyear studios.)[https://www.newyearstudios.com/] This was our first title to work on together, and my first time doing any start-to-finish programmatic work. I learned a lot through the crucible of troubleshooting, and hindsight. Feel free to fork it, clone it, or do what you like. :) Newyear Studios also has plenty of other open source game development assets available. We strive to create quality open source content to share with others and better the FOSS community.

(alexmorris.dev)[https://gitlab.com/matrix8967/alexmorris.dev] Whoa recursion! You can see all the code, commits, and build status for this site on Gitlab. Signed Commits by default. I need to reset the head to be from the fork project.

(Scripts)[https://gitlab.com/matrix8967/scripts] This is a repo of (mostly bash) scripts that I try to keep on hand. I've got a way of making any place my own.
