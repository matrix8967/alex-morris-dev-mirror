<a href="https://gitlab.com/newyearstudios/ritual-jam">Segmentation_Fault</a> is a game I made as part of <a href="https://www.newyearstudios.com/">newyear studios.</a> This was our first title to work on together, and my first time doing any start-to-finish programmatic work. I learned a lot through the crucible of troubleshooting, and hindsight. Feel free to fork it, clone it, or do what you like. Feedback is also very important. :) Newyear Studios also has plenty of other open source game development assets available. We strive to create quality open source content to share with others and better the FOSS community.

<a href="https://gitlab.com/matrix8967/alexmorris.dev">alexmorris.dev</a> Whoa recursion! ü§Ø You can see all the code, <a href="https://gitlab.com/matrix8967/alexmorris.dev/commits/master"> (Signed) Commits</a>, and <a href="https://gitlab.com/matrix8967/alexmorris.dev/-/jobs">Watch the CI/CD jobs in real time</a> on Gitlab. üëç I need to reset the head to be from the upstream project though.

<a href="https://gitlab.com/matrix8967/scripts">Scripts</a> is a repo of (mostly bash) scripts that I try to keep on hand. That way I've got a way of making any place my own. I distro hop a lot.
