<p>When I graduated highschool, I said I would never go back, even if they paid me. They said they would pay me, and I went back immediately. I graduated from Sheridan School District in 2007(‡) and from 2009 -&gt; 2013 I worked as Tier-01 IT. While I did not graduate from Bryant School District, I did work there from 2013 -&gt; 2018. This is where I really came into my own as a Linux Server Administrator. I built a KVM/Qemu VM Cluster using ProxMox to get a tourniquet on our aging and expensive VMWare cluster.</p>

<p>From 2018 until now I’ve been working at a startup in Little Rock. This is a combination of job titles that changes every hour or so depending on what’s happening or not happening that day: DevOps, Network Engineer, SysAdmin, CertBot, Technology Crisis Manager. My latest project was quietly re-rolling our core network infrastructure. I know it sounds lame. But it was a really rewarding experience for everyone to come in on that Monday, and have no idea anything had changed. I’m kind of a flight-risk when it comes to the spotlight. I’ve also developed a couple of other projects to help keep the wheels on the bus.</p>

<p>I’d love to work somewhere that focuses on Free and Open Source Technology in a <a href="https://alexmorris.dev/about.html">meaningful sense</a>.</p>

<p>I hate progress bars, so I made a “skill tree” to keep my false sense of superiority in Résumé layouts. It’s a testament to over engineering, so here’s the <a href="assets/text/Resume.txt">plain text</a> if you want to cut the bullshit and <code class="highlighter-rouge">curl</code> it into your shell, or you use arch btw.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> Is it still tacky to put Git on a resume in 2019? I figured it’s implied since this is a <a href="https://alexmorris.dev/projects.html">gitlab</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/matrix8967/alexmorris.dev">site…</a></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">‡</code> From 2007 until 2009, I attended and dropped out of Community College. Robert Frost said “Don’t cut what you can’t untie” but that dude wasn’t staring down the barrel of a student loan crisis. When I find myself in a hole; I quit digging. Also during this time, I was the worlds worst printer salesman at Office Depot. No, you don’t need to buy an accidental protection plan for your printer. What’re you taking your printer to the lake this weekend? C’mon.</p>
