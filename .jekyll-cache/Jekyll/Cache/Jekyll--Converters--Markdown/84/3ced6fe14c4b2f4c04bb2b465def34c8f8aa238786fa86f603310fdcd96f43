<p>Hello Friend,</p>

<p>As you‚Äôre no doubt aware, my name is Alex.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm a Systems Engineer by day, and a Systems Engineer by night.</p>

<p>At an early age - the magic of a computer, and the internet was instilled in me. I grew up with a free and open internet.</p>

<p>This was an internet where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Women could be treated as peers and equals with (or without) the cloak of anonymity.</li>
  <li>Men were unbound from the chains of traditional masculinity and could loudly exclaim: ‚Äú19/f/cali.‚Äù</li>
  <li>Large Corporations were still trying to find their footing on the Information Super Highway, instead of turning it into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon">Panopticon</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These early experiences with technology shaped who I am today. Which is a 30 year old man, sitting next to a custom built super computer, writing text into a terminal occupying 3.5mb of ram.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm an often outspoken FOSS and Privacy advocate and slayer of Privacy Nihilism. During my decade working in K12, I was involved in a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/privacy-practice-not-just-policy-system-administrator-advocating-student-privacy">case study from the EFF</a> regarding the abuse of student information at the hands of Google.  Where I was indoctrinated with a free and open internet, many children are being indoctrinated to view the internet through the lens of the world‚Äôs largest Ad Agency. This internet teaches them exchanging PII for convenience is a worthy trade, and often the only option. I‚Äôm optimistic that we will look back on these days of the internet like we now look at old cigarette ads. Facebook is just Lucky Strikes.</p>

<p>Most recently I was published in the <a href="https://store.2600.com/collections/2010-2015/products/autumn-2019">Autumn 2019 (Digital) Edition of 2600</a>: The Hacker Quarterly on the same topic. This was a childhood dream come true. Seeing my words in a publication that means so much to me is surreal. Shame that it had to be for something so bleak. But there‚Äôs no virtue in not knowing.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm a life long advocate for self hosting. I believe that End-to-End Encrypted <em>AND</em> Federated/Zero Knowledge services are going to become more and more prevalent in the years to come. Services like TOR, Firefox, Matrix.org, Signal, ProtonMail, and NextCloud, are already showing the growing trend for Privacy as a Right ‚Äì not Privacy as a Service.</p>

<p>Hunter S. Thompson once said: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to be crazy, you have to get paid for it or else you‚Äôre going to be locked up.‚Äù So outside of trying to turn my anxiety into a career for myself, I also enjoy video games, music, homebrew (software +/- beer), gallows humor, rain on the roof, the fourth amendment, books, and reverse pickpocketing.</p>

<p>Nobody ever said the good fight would be easy. I will not wear a wishbone where my backbone should be. I have an ethical and moral responsibility to those I love to build a better future. I always leave things better than you found them, and I intend to do the same for the internet.</p>

<p>If that‚Äôs on brand for you, drop a line.</p>
