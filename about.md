> âœ“ I am not a Robot.

Hello,

As I'm sure you're aware, my name is Alex.

I'm a Systems Engineer by day, and a Systems Engineer by night.

Like others my age - I spent as much time as possible on the family computer. Sometimes breaking it. Sometimes fixing it. Sometimes improving it. I enjoyed the scary freedoms of the boundless wilderness in my `IRL life`, and in my `Digital Life` .

The Strange and Interesting internet I grew up with meant:
  * Women could be treated as peers and equals with (or without) the cloak of anonymity.
  * Men were unbound from the chains of traditional masculinity and could loudly exclaim: "19/f/cali."  
  * Marginalized voices from all over the globe had a refuge.
  * Large Corporations were still trying to find their footing on the Information Super Highway, instead of turning it into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon">Panopticon</a>.

During my ~10 years in K12 Education I was a heavily outspoken critic of the pipelines schools are building to commodify student information. So much that I wrote an article published in the <a href="https://store.2600.com/products/winter-2019-2020">Winter 2019/2020 Issue of 2600: The Hacker Quarterly</a> and was interviewed under an alias for a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/privacy-practice-not-just-policy-system-administrator-advocating-student-privacy">case study from the EFF</a>.

Hunter S. Thompson said: "If you're going to be crazy, you have to get paid for it or else you're going to be locked up." So outside of trying to turn my anxiety into a career, I also enjoy video games, music, hacking, homebrew (software +/- beer), gallows humor, rain on the roof, the fourth amendment, books, being all in, and anything that's honest.

Nobody said the good fight would be easy. I don't wear a wishbone where my backbone should be. I've never begged to differ - I've just differed. I have an ethical and moral responsibility to those I love to build a better future. I always leave things better than I found them, and I intend to do the same for the internet.

If that's on brand for you, drop a line.
