Hello Friend.

I'm a Systems Engineer by day, and a Systems Engineer by night.

Growing up in a rural small town showed me first hand how vital a free, open, and healthy internet would be for the future.

From an early age, I enjoyed the scary freedoms of the boundless wilderness; in my `IRL life`, and in my `Digital Life`.

I spent as much time as possible on the family computer. Sometimes breaking it. Sometimes fixing it. Sometimes improving it. But always learning.

I'm an often outspoken FOSS and Privacy Advocate and slayer of [Privacy Nihilism.](https://text.mainframe.computer/2020/10/05/Securi-tea-01.html)

I have an ethical and moral responsibility to those I love to push for a better future. I leave things better than I find them, and I will do the same for the internet. Nobody said the good fight was going to be easy, but I don't wear a wishbone where my backbone should be. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

I endeavor to build ethical, open, and secure systems with every problem I solve (and prevent). I'm not old enough to know everything, and I'm not smart enough to build complicated systems.

Hunter S. Thompson said: "If you're going to be crazy, you have to get paid for it or else you're going to be locked up." So outside of turning my OCD into a career, I enjoy video/board games, music, hacking, homebrew (software +/- beer), gallows humor, rain on the roof, the fourth amendment, good movies, bad books, going all in, and anything that's honest.

If that's on brand for you, drop a line.
