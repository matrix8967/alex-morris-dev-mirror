`✓ I am not a Robot.`

Hello Friend.

I'm a Systems Engineer by day, and a Systems Engineer by night.

I spent as much time as possible on the family computer. Sometimes breaking it. Sometimes fixing it. Sometimes improving it. I enjoyed the scary freedoms of the boundless wilderness in my `IRL life`, and in my `Digital Life`.

I endeavor to build ethical, open, and secure systems in everything I build.

Nobody said the good fight was going to be easy. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` I don't beg to differ - I just differ. I'm not smart enough to build complicated systems. I have an ethical and moral responsibility to those I love to push for a better future. I leave things better than I find them, and I will do the same for the internet.

Hunter S. Thompson said: "If you're going to be crazy, you have to get paid for it or else you're going to be locked up." So outside of turning my anxiety into a career, I enjoy video/board games, music, hacking, homebrew (software +/- beer), gallows humor, rain on the roof, the fourth amendment, good books, bad books, going all in, and anything else that's honest.

If that's on brand for you, drop a line.
