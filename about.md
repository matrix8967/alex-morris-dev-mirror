`✓ I am not a Robot.`

Hello Friend.

I'm a Systems Engineer by day, and a Systems Engineer by night.

Like others my age - I spent as much time as possible on the family computer. Sometimes breaking it. Sometimes fixing it. Sometimes improving it. I enjoyed the scary freedoms of the boundless wilderness in my `IRL life`, and in my `Digital Life` .

In the Strange and Dynamic Internet I grew up with:
  * Women could be treated as peers and equals with (or without) the cloak of anonymity.
  * Men were unbound from the chains of traditional masculinity and could loudly exclaim: "19/f/cali."  
  * Children were undercover federal agents.
  * Marginalized voices from all over the globe had a voice.
  * Corporations were still finding their footing in cyberspace, instead of turning it into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon">Panopticon</a>.

I endeavor to build ethical, open, and secure systems in every aspect of my life.

Nobody said the good fight was going to be easy. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` I've never begged to differ - I just differ. I have an ethical and moral responsibility to those I love to push for a better future. I leave things better than I find them, and I will do the same for the internet.

Hunter S. Thompson said: "If you're going to be crazy, you have to get paid for it or else you're going to be locked up." So outside of turning my anxiety into a career, I enjoy video/board games, music, hacking, homebrew (software +/- beer), gallows humor, rain on the roof, the fourth amendment, good books, bad books, going all in, and anything else that's honest.

If that's on brand for you, drop a line.
