> âœ“ I am not a Robot.

Hello Friend,
As you're no doubt aware, my name is Alex.

I'm a Systems Engineer by day, and a Systems Engineer by night.

Like most humans, I had a strange upbringing. Our house was one of the earliest houses to get (dial-up) internet in the early 90's. It became a neighborhood attraction of sorts. People would gather around on weekend nights to experience the "World Wide Web" in our small trailer. Early websites, and chat rooms, and games were a staple of weekend nights. And since it was dial-up - the adults had plenty of time for a beer and a cigarette between page loads.

At an early age - the magic of a computer, and the internet was instilled in me. I grew up with a free and open internet.

An internet where:
  * Women could be treated as peers and equals under the cloak of anonymity.
  * Men were not confined to the chains of traditional masculinity and loudly exclaim: "19/f/cali."
  * Large Corporations were still trying to find their footing on the Information Super Highway, instead of turning it into a Panopticon.

These early experiences with technology shaped who I am today. (Which is a 30 year old man, sitting next to a custom built super computer, writing text into a terminal occupying 3.5mb of ram.)

It was a natural progression of my upbringing that led me to discovering Linux and FOSS Technology as a whole. (HMU if you wanna talk about TempleOS, ReactOS, Plan9, Redox, Hannah Montana Linux, etc.)

I'm an often outspoken FOSS and Privacy advocate. During my decade working in K12, I was involved in a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/privacy-practice-not-just-policy-system-administrator-advocating-student-privacy">case study from the EFF</a> regarding the abuse student information in schools around the nation at the hands of Google. Where I was raised with a free and open internet, many children are being raised on an internet crafted for them by the world's largest Ad Agency. An internet that teaches them exchanging PII for convenience is a worthy trade, instead of letting them make that choice at an appropriate age.

Most recently I was published in the <a href="https://store.2600.com/collections/2010-2015/products/autumn-2019">Autumn 2019 (Digital) Edition of 2600</a>: The Hacker Quarterly on the same topic. This was a childhood dream come true -- to see my words in a publication that has meant so much to me was a surreal experience. It saddens me that it had to be for something so bleak. But I've never had a problem saying what needs to be said.

I hold an unpopular opinion of not wanting to shovel anymore money into the furnace of Jeff Bezos. I believe that End-to-End Encrypted *AND* Federated/Zero Knowledge services are going to become more and more prevalent in the years to come. Services like TOR, Firefox, Matrix.org, Signal, ProtonMail, Briar, Keybase, NextCloud, and Mastodon are already showing the growing trend for Privacy as a Right -- not Privacy as a Service.

One of my favorite authors once said: "If you're going to be crazy, you have to get paid for it or else you're going to be locked up." So outside of trying to turn my anxiety into a career for myself, I also enjoy video games, music, homebrew (software +/- beer), gallows humor, rain on the roof, the fourth amendment, books, and poorly written words.

I also recently won an award at my current job for being super nice.

Please stop reading this now and go look at the other pages on this site for more information about my work. :)
