### git blame IRL:

When I graduated high-school in 2007 I said I'd never go back even if they paid me. Shortly afterwards, I was offered a job and I went back without question.

I continued working in K-12 schools for a decade where I focused on Automation, Virtualization, and security using Open Source Tools. (_Public Funds? Public Code._)

I left K12 to work at an Education Software Startup in Little Rock. I began as a DevOps Engineer, but took on various roles in our Engineering and Operations Departments before finally settling into the role of _Network Security Engineer_.

As of October 2021 I've taken a sabbatical to focus on personal and technical projects.
